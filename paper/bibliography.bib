We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

Often, this monitoring activity is conducted by an independent group of experts, often referred to as a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC responsibility includes monitoring for early evidence of a harmful effect or convincing evidence of a benefit. If the data are consistent and overwhelming, the DMC may recommend that a trial be terminated early. Trials may also be terminated early if the initial goal of demonstrating a benefit cannot in all likelihood be attained, or is futile. These are complicated issues and should be sorted out in the protocol and the DMC charter prior to the start of the trial before data begin to accumulate. Several statistical methods have been developed to assist a DMC in determining when a negative or harmful trend is substantial enough to render the trial continuation futile. These will be briefly summarized. However useful these methods might be, they alone are not adequate to make the decision and the DMC must take into account other issues to make a judgment.},

    abstract = { Ruling out the possibility that there is absolutely no effect or association between variables may be a good first step, but it is rarely the ultimate goal of science. Yet that is the only inference provided by traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which has been a mainstay of many scientific fields. Reliance on NHST also makes it difficult to define what it means to replicate a finding, and leads to an uncomfortable quandary in which increasing precision in data reduces researchers' ability to perform theory falsification. To solve these problems, in recent years several alternatives to traditional NHST have been proposed. However, each new test is described using its own terminology and practiced in different fields. We describe a simple, unified framework for conceptualizing all these tests so that it is not necessary to learn them separately. Moreover, the framework allows researchers to conduct any of these tests by asking just one question: is the confidence interval entirely outside the null region(s)? This framework may also help researchers choose the test(s) that best answers their research question when simply ruling out ‘no effect at all’ is not enough. }

	abstract = {Background
This article addresses a problem arising when a trial shows such strong evidence of benefit of the tested intervention that it stops early with an observed effect size for the experimental treatment that is statistically significantly better than the control. Within the classical frequentist framework of group sequential trials, the observed estimated effect size, the associated naïve confidence interval, and the p-value are all biased estimates of the true values. The bias is in the direction of the overestimation of the treatment effect, creation of narrower confidence intervals than appropriate, and a p-value that is too small.
Purpose
To discuss methods for correcting the bias in observed effect sizes, confidence intervals, and p-values for trials stopped early and to show the extent to which such correction would have modified the conclusions of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES).
Results
In RALES, the effect of not correcting for bias is negligible.
Limitations
This article does not show general results; it only explores a few examples that use conservative methods for early stopping. It does not consider sequential methods that allow a relatively high probability of stopping early.
Conclusions
This article points out that there is no unique solution to the correction of the p-value, but it recommends stagewise ordering, which states that earlier stopping of a trial is ipso facto stronger evidence of effect than later stopping so long as the stopping is governed by a monitoring boundary that preserves the Type I error rate. Associated with stagewise ordering is a method for calculating the estimated effect size and its confidence interval. In the RALES trial, which stopped at 50\% information time, the corrections to the estimated values are small.},

By promoting the evaluation of existing studies to confirm their reliability, replications play a unique, though often underappreciated, role in the scientific enterprise. Involving students early in this process can help make replication mainstream among the new generation of scientists. Beyond their benefit to science, replications also provide an invaluable learning ground for students, from encouraging the development of critical thinking to emphasizing the importance of details and honing research skills. In this piece, we outline 10 simple rules for designing and conducting undergraduate replication projects, from conceptualization to implementation and dissemination. We hope that these guidelines can help educators provide students with a meaningful and constructive pedagogical experience, without compromising the scientific value of the replication project, therefore ensuring robust, valuable contributions to our understanding of the world.},

Further, the confidence set that is the inversion of the usual two-sided Fisher’s exact test may not be an interval, so following Blaker (2000, Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions. Canadian Journal of Statistics 28, 783–798), we define the “matching” interval as the smallest interval that contains the confidence set. We explore these 2 versions of Fisher’s exact test as well as an exact test suggested by Blaker (2000) and provide the R package exact2×2 which automatically assigns the appropriate matching interval to each of the 3 exact tests.},

Here we investigate the particular case of meta-analysis of a pair of studies, for example, summarizing the results of two confirmatory clinical trials in phase III of a clinical development program. Thereby, we focus on the question of to what extent homogeneity or heterogeneity may be discernible and include an empirical investigation of published (“twin”) pairs of studies. A pair of estimates from two studies only provide very little evidence of homogeneity or heterogeneity of effects, and ad hoc decision criteria may often be misleading.},

Statistical significance itself alone, however, may not be sufficient to establish that the drug is clinically effective enough to warrant confirmatory phase III trials. We propose the Bayesian optimal phase II trial design with dual-criterion decision making (BOP2-DC), which incorporates both statistical significance and clinical relevance into decision making. Based on the posterior probability that the treatment effect reaches the lower reference value (statistical significance) and the clinically meaningful value (clinical significance), BOP2-DC allows for go/consider/no-go decisions, rather than a binary go/no-go decision. BOP2-DC is highly flexible and accommodates various types of endpoints, including binary, continuous, time-to-event, multiple, and coprimary endpoints, in single-arm and randomized trials. The decision rule of BOP2-DC is optimized to maximize the probability of a go decision when the treatment is effective or minimize the expected sample size when the treatment is futile. Simulation studies show that the BOP2-DC design yields desirable operating characteristics. The software to implement BOP2-DC is freely available at www.trialdesign.org.},

We extracted data on study characteristics, statistical plan, accrual, and outcomes. Observed power (Pobs) was calculated based on completed study characteristics and observed hazard ratio (HRobs). Studies were considered over-sampled if Pobs {\textgreater} expected with HRobs similar or worse than expected or if Pobs was similar to expected with HRobs worse than expected. We explored associations with over-sampling using logistic regression. Of 75 drug approvals (reporting 94 endpoints), 21\% (20/94) were over-sampled. Over-sampling was associated with immunotherapy (OR: 5.5; p = 0.04) and associated quantitatively but not statistically with targeted therapy (OR: 3.0), open-label trials (OR: 2.5), and melanoma (OR: 4.6) and lung cancer (OR: 2.17) relative to breast cancer. Most cancer drug approvals are supported by trials with justified sample sizes. Approximately 1 in 5 endpoints are over-sampled; benefit observed may not translate to clinically meaningful real-world outcomes.},

	abstract = {When the editors of Basic and Applied Social Psychology effectively banned the use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) from articles published in their journal, it set off a fire-storm of discussions both supporting the decision and defending the utility of NHST in scientific research. At the heart of NHST is the pvalue which is the probability of obtaining an effect equal to or more extreme than the one observed in the sample data, given the null hypothesis and other model assumptions. Although this is conceptually different from the probability of the null hypothesis being true, given the sample, p-values nonetheless can provide evidential information, toward making an inference about a parameter. Applying a 10,000-case simulation described in this article, the authors found that p-values’ inferential signals to either reject or not reject a null hypothesis about the mean ( α = 0.05) were consistent for almost 70\% of the cases with the parameter’s true location for the sampled-from population. Success increases if a hybrid decision criterion, minimum effect size plus p-value (MESP), is used. Here, rejecting the null also requires the difference of the observed statistic from the exact null to be meaningfully large or practically significant, in the researcher’s judgment and experience. The simulation compares performances of several methods: from p-value and/or effect sizebased, to confidence-interval based, under various conditions of true location of the mean, test power, and comparative sizes of the meaningful distance and population variability. For any inference procedure that outputs a binary indicator, like flagging whether a p-value is significant, the output of one single experiment is not sufficient evidence for a definitive conclusion. Yet, if a tool like MESP generates a relatively reliable signal and is used knowledgeably as part of a research process, it can provide useful information.},

	abstract = {Objective To explore how design emulation and population differences relate to variation in results between randomised controlled trials (RCT) and non-randomised real world evidence (RWE) studies, based on the RCT-DUPLICATE initiative (Randomised, Controlled Trials Duplicated Using Prospective Longitudinal Insurance Claims: Applying Techniques of Epidemiology).
Design Meta-analysis of RCT-DUPLICATE data.
Data sources Trials included in RCT-DUPLICATE, a demonstration project that emulated 32 randomised controlled trials using three real world data sources: Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, 2004-19; IBM MarketScan, 2003-17; and subsets of Medicare parts A, B, and D, 2009-17.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Trials where the primary analysis resulted in a hazard ratio; 29 RCT-RWE study pairs from RCT-DUPLICATE.
Results Differences and variation in effect sizes between the results from randomised controlled trials and real world evidence studies were investigated. Most of the heterogeneity in effect estimates between the RCT-RWE study pairs in this sample could be explained by three emulation differences in the meta-regression model: treatment started in hospital (which does not appear in health insurance claims data), discontinuation of some baseline treatments at randomisation (which would have been an unusual care decision in clinical practice), and delayed onset of drug effects (which would be under-reported in real world clinical practice because of the relatively short persistence of the treatment). Adding the three emulation differences to the meta-regression reduced heterogeneity from 1.9 to almost 1 (absence of heterogeneity).
Conclusions This analysis suggests that a substantial proportion of the observed variation between results from randomised controlled trials and real world evidence studies can be attributed to differences in design emulation.},

Methodology from the metaanalysis literature provides an approach for quantifying the heterogeneity present in RPs, as additive or multiplicative parameter.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Nonrandomized studies using insurance claims databases can be analyzed to produce real-world evidence on the effectiveness of medical products. Given the lack of baseline randomization and measurement issues, concerns exist about whether such studies produce unbiased treatment effect estimates.
OBJECTIVE: To emulate the design of 30 completed and 2 ongoing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications with database studies using observational analogues of the RCT design parameters (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, time [PICOT]) and to quantify agreement in RCT-database study pairs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: New-user cohort studies with propensity score matching using 3 US claims databases (Optum Clinformatics, MarketScan, and Medicare). Inclusion-exclusion criteria for each database study were prespecified to emulate the corresponding RCT. RCTs were explicitly selected based on feasibility, including power, key confounders, and end points more likely to be emulated with real-world data. All 32 protocols were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov before conducting analyses. Emulations were conducted from 2017 through 2022.
EXPOSURES: Therapies for multiple clinical conditions were included.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Database study emulations focused on the primary outcome of the corresponding RCT. Findings of database studies were compared with RCTs using predefined metrics, including Pearson correlation coefficients and binary metrics based on statistical significance agreement, estimate agreement, and standardized difference.
RESULTS: In these highly selected RCTs, the overall observed agreement between the RCT and the database emulation results was a Pearson correlation of 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.91), with 75\% meeting statistical significance, 66\% estimate agreement, and 75\% standardized difference agreement. In a post hoc analysis limited to 16 RCTs with closer emulation of trial design and measurements, concordance was higher (Pearson r, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.79-0.97; 94\% meeting statistical significance, 88\% estimate agreement, 88\% standardized difference agreement). Weaker concordance occurred among 16 RCTs for which close emulation of certain design elements that define the research question (PICOT) with data from insurance claims was not possible (Pearson r, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.83; 56\% meeting statistical significance, 50\% estimate agreement, 69\% standardized difference agreement).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Real-world evidence studies can reach similar conclusions as RCTs when design and measurements can be closely emulated, but this may be difficult to achieve. Concordance in results varied depending on the agreement metric. Emulation differences, chance, and residual confounding can contribute to divergence in results and are difficult to disentangle.},

While the classical Type I error is commonly used to evaluate such designs, it cannot be strictly controlled and it is acknowledged that other metrics may be more appropriate. We focus on two common situations—borrowing control data or information on the treatment contrast—and discuss several fully probabilistic metrics to evaluate the risk of false positive conclusions. Each metric requires specification of a design prior, which can differ from the analysis prior and permits understanding of the behavior of a Bayesian design under scenarios where the analysis prior differs from the true data generation process. The metrics include the average Type I error and the pre-posterior probability of a false positive result. When borrowing control data, our empirical cases demonstrate that the average Type I error is asymptotically controlled (in certain cases strictly) when the analysis and design prior coincide. We illustrate use of these Bayesian metrics with real applications, and discuss how they could facilitate discussions between sponsors, regulators and other stakeholders about the appropriateness of Bayesian borrowing designs for pivotal studies.},

A decision is taken on whether the experimental treatment is further developed (GO), whether its development is stopped (NO-GO), or whether further information is needed to make a decision. The PoC decision is typically based on a PoC clinical trial in patients comparing the experimental treatment with a control treatment. It is important that the PoC trial be designed such that a GO/ NO-GO decision can be made. The present work develops a generic, Bayesian framework for defining quantitative PoC criteria, against which the PoC trial results can be assessed. It is argued that PoC criteria based solely on significance testing versus the control are not appropriate in this decision context. A dual PoC criterion is proposed that includes assessment of superiority over the control and relevance of the effect size and hence better matches clinical decision making. The approach is illustrated for 2 PoC trials in cystic fibrosis and psoriasis.},

	abstract = {Background: Well-designed phase II trials must have acceptable error rates relative to a pre-specified success criterion, usually a statistically significant p-value. Such standard designs may not always suffice from a clinical perspective because clinical relevance may call for more. For example, proof-of-concept in phase II often requires not only statistical significance but also a sufficiently large effect estimate.
Purpose: We propose dual-criterion designs to complement statistical significance with clinical relevance, discuss their methodology, and illustrate their implementation in phase II.
Methods: Clinical relevance requires the effect estimate to pass a clinically motivated threshold (the decision value (DV)). In contrast to standard designs, the required effect estimate is an explicit design input, whereas study power is implicit. The sample size for a dual-criterion design needs careful considerations of the study’s operating characteristics (type I error, power).
Results: Dual-criterion designs are discussed for a randomized controlled and a single-arm phase II trial, including decision criteria, sample size calculations, decisions under various data scenarios, and operating characteristics. The designs facilitate GO/NO-GO decisions due to their complementary statistical–clinical criterion. Limitations: While conceptually simple, implementing a dual-criterion design needs care. The clinical DV must be elicited carefully in collaboration with clinicians, and understanding similarities and differences to a standard design is crucial.
Conclusion: To improve evidence-based decision-making, a formal yet transparent quantitative framework is important. Dual-criterion designs offer an appealing statistical–clinical compromise, which may be preferable to standard designs if evidence against the null hypothesis alone does not suffice for an efficacy claim.},

Results 323 IPD meta-analyses covering 21 clinical areas and published between 1991 and 2019 were included: 270 (84\%) were non-Cochrane reviews and 269 (84\%) were published in journals with a high impact factor (top quarter). The IPD meta-analyses showed low compliance in using a satisfactory technique to assess the risk of bias of the included randomised controlled trials (43\%, 95\% confidence interval 38\% to 48\%), accounting for risk of bias when interpreting results (40\%, 34\% to 45\%), providing a list of excluded studies with justifications (32\%, 27\% to 37\%), establishing an a priori protocol (31\%, 26\% to 36\%), prespecifying methods for assessing both the overall effects (44\%, 39\% to 50\%) and the participant-intervention interactions (31\%, 26\% to 36\%), assessing and considering the potential of publication bias (31\%, 26\% to 36\%), and conducting a comprehensive literature search (19\%, 15\% to 23\%).

Conclusions The methodological quality of IPD meta-analyses is unsatisfactory. Future IPD meta-analyses need to establish an a priori protocol with prespecified data syntheses plan, comprehensively search the literature, critically appraise included randomised controlled trials with appropriate technique, account for risk of bias during data analyses and interpretation, and account for unavailable IPD.},

	abstract = {Background
Bayesian adaptive methods are increasingly being used to design clinical trials and offer several advantages over traditional approaches. Decisions at analysis points are usually based on the posterior distribution of the treatment effect. However, there is some confusion as to whether control of type I error is required for Bayesian designs as this is a frequentist concept.

Methods
We discuss the arguments for and against adjusting for multiplicities in Bayesian trials with interim analyses. With two case studies we illustrate the effect of including interim analyses on type I/II error rates in Bayesian clinical trials where no adjustments for multiplicities are made. We propose several approaches to control type I error, and also alternative methods for decision-making in Bayesian clinical trials.

Results
In both case studies we demonstrated that the type I error was inflated in the Bayesian adaptive designs through incorporation of interim analyses that allowed early stopping for efficacy and without adjustments to account for multiplicity. Incorporation of early stopping for efficacy also increased the power in some instances. An increase in the number of interim analyses that only allowed early stopping for futility decreased the type I error, but also decreased power. An increase in the number of interim analyses that allowed for either early stopping for efficacy or futility generally increased type I error and decreased power.

Conclusions
Currently, regulators require demonstration of control of type I error for both frequentist and Bayesian adaptive designs, particularly for late-phase trials. To demonstrate control of type I error in Bayesian adaptive designs, adjustments to the stopping boundaries are usually required for designs that allow for early stopping for efficacy as the number of analyses increase. If the designs only allow for early stopping for futility then adjustments to the stopping boundaries are not needed to control type I error. If one instead uses a strict Bayesian approach, which is currently more accepted in the design and analysis of exploratory trials, then type I errors could be ignored and the designs could instead focus on the posterior probabilities of treatment effects of clinically-relevant values.},

	abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sample size derivation is a crucial element of planning any confirmatory trial. The required sample size is typically derived based on constraints on the maximal acceptable Type I error rate and minimal desired power. Power depends on the unknown true effect and tends to be calculated either for the smallest relevant effect or a likely point alternative. The former might be problematic if the minimal relevant effect is close to the null, thus requiring an excessively large sample size, while the latter is dubious since it does not account for the a priori uncertainty about the likely alternative effect. A Bayesian perspective on sample size derivation for a frequentist trial can reconcile arguments about the relative a priori plausibility of alternative effects with ideas based on the relevance of effect sizes. Many suggestions as to how such “hybrid” approaches could be implemented in practice have been put forward. However, key quantities are often defined in subtly different ways in the literature. Starting from the traditional entirely frequentist approach to sample size derivation, we derive consistent definitions for the most commonly used hybrid quantities and highlight connections, before discussing and demonstrating their use in sample size derivation for clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Interim findings of a clinical trial often will be useful for increasing the sample size if necessary to provide the required power against the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. Strategies for carrying out the interim examination that have been described over the past several years include ‘internal pilot studies’, blinded interim sample size adjustment and conditional power. Simulation studies show that the alternative methods generally control the type I error rate satisfactorily, although the power properties are more variable. The important issues associated with sample size re-estimation are strategic, not numeric. Clearly expressed regulatory preferences suggest that methods not requiring unblinding the data before completion of the trial would be most appropriate. Extending a trial has its risks. The investigators/patients enrolled later in the course of a trial are not necessarily the same as those recruited/entered early. Re-activating the enrolment process may be sufficiently complicated and expensive to justify enrolling more investigators/patients at the outset. Since sample size re-estimation adjusts the sample size on the basis of variability while efficacy interim analysis adjusts the sample size based on the basis of estimated effect size, both principles can be used in the same trial. Sample size re-estimation may not be advisable for trials involving extended follow-up of individual patients or, more generally, when the follow-up time is long relative to the recruitment time. In such cases, it may be better to estimate the sample size conservatively and introduce an interim efficacy evaluation. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A loss function is specified, based on the cost for each patient and the costs of making incorrect decisions at the end of a trial. At each interim analysis, the decision to terminate or to continue the trial is based on the expected loss function while concurrently incorporating efficacy, futility and cost. The maximum number of interim analyses is determined adaptively by the observed data. We derive explicit connections between the loss function and the frequentist error rates, so that the desired frequentist properties can be maintained for regulatory settings. The operating characteristics of the design can be evaluated on frequentist grounds. Extensive simulations are carried out to compare the proposed design with existing ones. The design is general enough to accommodate both continuous and discrete types of data. We illustrate the methods with an animal study evaluating a medical treatment for cardiac arrest.},

As stated in recent FDA guidance on adaptive designs, it is desirable to report estimates of treatment effects that reduce or remove this bias. However, it may be unclear which of the available estimators are preferable, and their use remains rare in practice. This article is the second in a two‐part series that studies the issue of bias in point estimation for adaptive trials. Part I provided a methodological review of approaches to remove or reduce the potential bias in point estimation for adaptive designs. In part II, we discuss how bias can affect standard estimators and assess the negative impact this can have. We review current practice for reporting point estimates and illustrate the computation of different estimators using a real adaptive trial example (including code), which we use as a basis for a simulation study. We show that while on average the values of these estimators can be similar, for a particular trial realization they can give noticeably different values for the estimated treatment effect. Finally, we propose guidelines for researchers around the choice of estimators and the reporting of estimates following an adaptive design. The issue of bias should be considered throughout the whole lifecycle of an adaptive design, with the estimation strategy prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. When available, unbiased or bias‐reduced estimates are to be preferred.},

Our aim with this article is to bring the existing methodology of group sequential designs to the attention of researchers in the preclinical field and to clearly illustrate its potential utility. Group sequential designs can offer higher efficiency than traditional methods and are increasingly used in clinical trials. Using simulation of data, we demonstrate that group sequential designs have the potential to improve the efficiency of experimental studies, even when sample sizes are very small, as is currently prevalent in preclinical experimental biomedicine. When simulating data with a large effect size of d = 1 and a sample size of n = 18 per group, sequential frequentist analysis consumes in the long run only around 80\% of the planned number of experimental units. In larger trials (n = 36 per group), additional stopping rules for futility lead to the saving of resources of up to 30\% compared to block designs. We argue that these savings should be invested to increase sample sizes and hence power, since the currently underpowered experiments in preclinical biomedicine are a major threat to the value and predictiveness in this research domain.},

	abstract = {Credibility of scientific claims is established with evidence for their replicability using new data. According to common understanding, replication is repeating a study’s procedure and observing whether the prior finding recurs. This definition is intuitive, easy to apply, and incorrect. We propose that replication is a study for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research. This definition reduces emphasis on operational characteristics of the study and increases emphasis on the interpretation of possible outcomes. The purpose of replication is to advance theory by confronting existing understanding with new evidence. Ironically, the value of replication may be strongest when existing understanding is weakest. Successful replication provides evidence of generalizability across the conditions that inevitably differ from the original study; Unsuccessful replication indicates that the reliability of the finding may be more constrained than recognized previously. Defining replication as a confrontation of current theoretical expectations clarifies its important, exciting, and generative role in scientific progress.},

Research into novel trial designs to facilitate this goal has led to, amongst other approaches, the development of methodology for seamless phase II/III designs. Such designs allow treatment or dose selection at an interim analysis and comparative evaluation of efficacy with control, in the same study. Methods have gained much attention because of their potential advantages compared to conventional drug development programmes with separate trials for individual phases. In this article, we review the various approaches to seamless phase II/III designs based upon the group-sequential approach, the combination test approach and the adaptive Dunnett method. The objective of this article is to describe the approaches in a unified framework and highlight their similarities and differences to allow choice of an appropriate methodology by a trialist considering conducting such a trial.},

	abstract = {Replication of published results is crucial for ensuring the robustness and self-correction of research, yet replications are scarce in many fields. Replicating researchers will therefore often have to decide which of several relevant candidates to target for replication. Formal strategies for efficient study selection have been proposed, but none have been explored for practical feasibility – a prerequisite for validation. Here we move one step closer to efficient replication study selection by exploring the feasibility of a particular selection strategy that estimates replication value as a function of citation impact and sample size (Isager, van 't Veer, \& Lakens, 2021). We tested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We first report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of replication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of estimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset of 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication. In addition, we carefully examine possible measures, test auxiliary assumptions, and identify boundary conditions of measuring value and uncertainty. We end our report by discussing how future validation studies might be designed. Our study demonstrates the importance of investigating how to implement study selection strategies in practice. Our sample and study design can be extended to explore the feasibility of other formal study selection strategies that have been proposed.},

Choosing the prior is crucial for the properties and interpretability of Bayesian predictive power. We review recommendations on the choice of prior for Bayesian predictive power and explore its features as a function of the prior. The density of power values induced by a given prior is derived analytically and its shape characterized. We find that for a typical clinical trial scenario, this density has a u-shape very similar, but not equal, to a β-distribution. Alternative priors are discussed, and practical recommendations to assess the sensitivity of Bayesian predictive power to its input parameters are provided.

	abstract = {Adaptive designs can make clinical trials more flexible by utilising results accumulating in the trial to modify the trial’s course in accordance with pre-specified rules. Trials with an adaptive design are often more efficient, informative and ethical than trials with a traditional fixed design since they often make better use of resources such as time and money, and might require fewer participants. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research, from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. The pace of the uptake of adaptive designs in clinical research, however, has remained well behind that of the statistical literature introducing new methods and highlighting their potential advantages. We speculate that one factor contributing to this is that the full range of adaptations available to trial designs, as well as their goals, advantages and limitations, remains unfamiliar to many parts of the clinical community. Additionally, the term adaptive design has been misleadingly used as an all-encompassing label to refer to certain methods that could be deemed controversial or that have been inadequately implemented.},

abstract = {Replicability of results is regarded as the corner stone of science. Recent research seems to raise doubts about whether this requirement is generally fulfilled. Often, replicability of results is defined as repeating a statistically significant result. However, since significance may not imply scientific relevance, dual-criterion study designs that take both aspects into account have been proposed and investigated during the last decade. Originally developed for proof-of-concept trials, the design could be appropriate for phase III trials as well. In fact, a dual-criterion design has been requested for COVID-19 vaccine applications by major health authorities. In this article, replicability of dual-criterion designs is investigated. It turns out that the probability to replicate a significant and relevant result can become as low as 0.5. The replication probability increases if the effect estimator exceeds the minimum relevant effect in the original study by an extra amount.},

Variables affecting the assessment of whether an RPC is important include when, how, and by whom the RPC was conducted. Conducting RPCs in batteries varying in degree of similarity to the original study may tell more about the external validity of the result being replicated. A useful view of RPC focuses on effect size as the more important summary statistic of a study and evaluates the success of an RPC in a continuous fashion. Concepts of a successful RPC are presented, some metrics of RPC success are described, and suggestions are offered as to what should be reported in an RPC study.

We outline how DAE methods can be used to plan and analyze simulation studies. Tools for planning include cause-and-effect diagrams and factorial and fractional factorial designs. Analysis is carried out via analysis of variance, main effect and interaction plots, and other DAE tools. We also demonstrate how Taguchi robust parameter design can be used to study the robustness of methods to a variety of uncontrollable population parameters.},

abstract = {Summary Meta-analysis is a common tool for synthesizing results of multiple studies. Among methods for performing meta-analysis, the approach known as ‘fixed effects’ or ‘inverse variance weighting’ is popular and widely used. A common interpretation of this method is that it assumes that the underlying effects in contributing studies are identical, and for this reason it is sometimes dismissed by practitioners. However, other interpretations of fixed effects analyses do not make this assumption, yet appear to be little known in the literature. We review these alternative interpretations, describing both their strengths and their limitations. We also describe how heterogeneity of the underlying effects can be addressed, with the same minimal assumptions, through either testing or meta-regression. Recommendations for the practice of meta-analysis are given; it is hoped that these will foster more direct connection of the questions that meta-analysts wish to answer with the statistical methods they choose.},

Meta-analyses of effects indicated an overall benefit in outcomes at discharge (odds ratio 1.75 (95\% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.35) for function, relative risk 0.64 (0.51 to 0.81) for nursing home admission, relative risk 0.72 (0.55 to 0.95) for mortality) and at end of follow-up (1.36 (1.07 to 1.71), 0.84 (0.72 to 0.99), 0.87 (0.77 to 0.97), respectively). Limited data were available on impact on health care or cost. Compared with those in control groups, weighted mean length of hospital stay after randomisation was longer in patients allocated to general geriatric rehabilitation (24.5 v 15.1 days) and shorter in patients allocated to orthopaedic rehabilitation (24.6 v 28.9 days).Conclusion Inpatient rehabilitation specifically designed for geriatric patients has the potential to improve outcomes related to function, admission to nursing homes, and mortality.

abstract = {Abstract Exploring the possible reasons for heterogeneity between studies is an important aspect of conducting a meta-analysis. This paper compares a number of methods which can be used to investigate whether a particular covariate, with a value defined for each study in the meta-analysis, explains any heterogeneity. The main example is from a meta-analysis of randomized trials of serum cholesterol reduction, in which the log-odds ratio for coronary events is related to the average extent of cholesterol reduction achieved in each trial. Different forms of weighted normal errors regression and random effects logistic regression are compared. These analyses quantify the extent to which heterogeneity is explained, as well as the effect of cholesterol reduction on the risk of coronary events. In a second example, the relationship between treatment effect estimates and their precision is examined, in order to assess the evidence for publication bias. We conclude that methods which allow for an additive component of residual heterogeneity should be used. In weighted regression, a restricted maximum likelihood estimator is appropriate, although a number of other estimators are also available. Methods which use the original form of the data explicitly, for example the binomial model for observed proportions rather than assuming normality of the log-odds ratios, are now computationally feasible. Although such methods are preferable in principle, they often give similar results in practice. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show how and explain why an unrestricted weighted least squares estimator is superior to conventional random-effects meta-analysis when there is publication (or small-sample) bias and better than a fixed-effect weighted average if there is heterogeneity. Statistical theory and simulations of effect sizes, log odds ratios and regression coefficients demonstrate that this unrestricted weighted least squares estimator provides satisfactory estimates and confidence intervals that are comparable to random effects when there is no publication (or small-sample) bias and identical to fixed-effect meta-analysis when there is no heterogeneity. When there is publication selection bias, the unrestricted weighted least squares approach dominates random effects; when there is excess heterogeneity, it is clearly superior to fixed-effect meta-analysis. In practical applications, an unrestricted weighted least squares weighted average will often provide superior estimates to both conventional fixed and random effects.

abstract = {Summary.  Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of ‘set shifting’ ability in people with eating disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Confidence intervals for a single parameter are spanned by quantiles of a confidence distribution, and one-sided p-values are cumulative confidences. Confidence distributions are thus a unifying format for representing frequentist inference for a single parameter. The confidence distribution, which depends on data, is exact (unbiased) when its cumulative distribution function evaluated at the true parameter is uniformly distributed over the unit interval. A new version of the Neyman-Pearson lemma is given, showing that the confidence distribution based on the natural statistic in exponential models with continuous data is less dispersed than all other confidence distributions, regardless of how dispersion is measured. Approximations are necessary for discrete data, and also in many models with nuisance parameters. Approximate pivots might then be useful. A pivot based on a scalar statistic determines a likelihood in the parameter of interest along with a confidence distribution. This proper likelihood is reduced of all nuisance parameters, and is appropriate for meta-analysis and updating of information. The reduced likelihood is generally different from the confidence density. Confidence distributions and reduced likelihoods are rooted in Fisher-Neyman statistics. This frequentist methodology has many of the Bayesian attractions, and the two approaches are briefly compared. Concepts, methods and techniques of this brand of Fisher-Neyman statistics are presented. Asymptotics and bootstrapping are used to find pivots and their distributions, and hence reduced likelihoods and confidence distributions. A simple form of inverting bootstrap distributions to approximate pivots of the abc type is proposed. Our material is illustrated in a number of examples and in an application to multiple capture data for bowhead whales.},

abstract = {Studies combined in a meta-analysis often have differences in their design and conduct that can lead to heterogeneous results. A random-effects model accounts for these differences in the underlying study effects, which includes a heterogeneity variance parameter. The DerSimonian-Laird method is often used to estimate the heterogeneity variance, but simulation studies have found the method can be biased and other methods are available. This paper compares the properties of nine different heterogeneity variance estimators using simulated meta-analysis data. Simulated scenarios include studies of equal size and of moderate and large differences in size. Results confirm that the DerSimonian-Laird estimator is negatively biased in scenarios with small studies and in scenarios with a rare binary outcome. Results also show the Paule-Mandel method has considerable positive bias in meta-analyses with large differences in study size. We recommend the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to estimate the heterogeneity variance over other methods. However, considering that meta-analyses of health studies typically contain few studies, the heterogeneity variance estimate should not be used as a reliable gauge for the extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. The estimated summary effect of the meta-analysis and its confidence interval derived from the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method are more robust to changes in the heterogeneity variance estimate and show minimal deviation from the nominal coverage of 95\% under most of our simulated scenarios.},

An alternative model, which assumes multiplicative heterogeneity, has been little used in the medical statistics community, but is widely used by particle physicists. In this paper, we compare the two models using a random sample of 448 meta-analyses drawn from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In general, differences in goodness of fit are modest. The multiplicative model tends to give results that are closer to the null, with a narrower confidence interval. Both approaches make different assumptions about the outcome of the meta-analysis. In our opinion, the selection of the more appropriate model will often be guided by whether the multiplicative model's assumption of a single effect size is plausible.

abstract = {Abstract The DerSimonian–Laird confidence interval for the average treatment effect in meta-analysis is widely used in practice when there is heterogeneity between studies. However, it is well known that its coverage probability (the probability that the interval actually includes the true value) can be substantially below the target level of 95 per cent. It can also be very sensitive to publication bias. In this paper, we propose a new confidence interval that has better coverage than the DerSimonian–Laird method, and that is less sensitive to publication bias. The key idea is to note that fixed effects estimates are less sensitive to such biases than random effects estimates, since they put relatively more weight on the larger studies and relatively less weight on the smaller studies. Whereas the DerSimonian–Laird interval is centred on a random effects estimate, we centre our confidence interval on a fixed effects estimate, but allow for heterogeneity by including an assessment of the extra uncertainty induced by the random effects setting. Properties of the resulting confidence interval are studied by simulation and compared with other random effects confidence intervals that have been proposed in the literature. An example is briefly discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper reports an investigation by four coordinated laboratories of the prospective replicability of 16 novel experimental findings using rigour-enhancing practices: confirmatory tests, large sample sizes, preregistration and methodological transparency. In contrast to past systematic replication efforts that reported replication rates averaging 50\%, replication attempts here produced the expected effects with significance testing (P {\textless} 0.05) in 86\% of attempts, slightly exceeding the maximum expected replicability based on observed effect sizes and sample sizes. When one lab attempted to replicate an effect discovered by another lab, the effect size in the replications was 97\% that in the original study. This high replication rate justifies confidence in rigour-enhancing methods to increase the replicability of new discoveries.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing has received a great amount of attention in recent years in the light of the reproducibility crisis of science. Recently, there have been calls to retire the dichotomization of study results into “significant” or “not significant” depending on whether the P value crosses some threshold or not. Ways of improving the interpretation of P values and confidence intervals are therefore needed. We illustrate the use of P value functions, which display confidence limits and P values for any confidence level for a parameter. P value functions accessibly display a wealth of information: point estimate for the parameter, one-sided and two-sided confidence limits at any level, and one-sided and two-sided P values for any null and non-null value and the counternull value. Presenting several recent examples from the literature, we show how P value functions can be applied to present evidence and to make informed statistical inferences without resorting to dichotomization. We argue that P value functions are more informative than commonly used summaries of study results such as single P values or confidence intervals. P value functions require minimal retraining, are easily interpreted, and show potential to fix many of the common misinterpretation of P values and confidence intervals. To facilitate the adoption of P value functions, we released an R package for creating P value functions for several commonly used estimates.},

abstract = "Carvedilol (Coreg®), a beta- and alpha-blocker and an antioxidant drug, was evaluated for moderate to severe heart failure patients in a program containing four United States and one Australia/New Zealand study. The data were evaluated twice by the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These meetings resulted in opposite decisions by the advisory committee. The crux of the argumentation was the two-positive-trial FDA paradigm. Carvedilol did not meet the usual paradigm because an exercise end point was not statistically different from placebo in three U.S. trials. Most other end points were highly significant, and death, which was monitored across the U.S. program, was different with p < 0.0001. Here we argue that the usual paradigm is very useful but not an absolute principle, that the usual paradigm can sometimes miss the strength of evidence even in the primary end points, and that rational decision making requires on occasion that other evidence must lead to approval. Control of the type I error rate should be taken very seriously, should rarely be violated, and serves the biomedical community well. It is not an absolute principle, however, but rather must be considered in context."

In this paper, I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP), a simple to use and widely applicable alternative to Bonferroni correction motivated by Bayesian model averaging that greatly improves statistical power while maintaining control of the gold standard false positive rate. The HMP has a range of desirable properties and offers a different way to think about large-scale exploratory data analysis in classical statistics.Analysis of {\textquotedblleft}big data{\textquotedblright} frequently involves statistical comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example, in the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false positives but makes it difficult to reach the multiple testing-corrected significance threshold. Here, I introduce the harmonic mean p-value (HMP), which controls the FWER while greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP effortlessly combines information to detect statistically significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a joint human{\textendash}pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini{\textendash}Hochberg procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it enhances the potential for scientific discovery.},

abstract = {Abstract In terms of the risk of making a Type I error in evaluating a null hypothesis of equality, requiring two independent confirmatory trials with two-sided p-values less than 0.05 is equivalent to requiring one confirmatory trial with two-sided p-value less than 0.001 25. Furthermore, the use of a single confirmatory trial is gaining acceptability, with discussion in both ICH E9 and a CPMP Points to Consider document. Given the growing acceptance of this approach, this note provides a formula for the sample size savings that are obtained with the single clinical trial approach depending on the levels of Type I and Type II errors chosen. For two replicate trials each powered at 90\%, which corresponds to a single larger trial powered at 81\%, an approximate 19\% reduction in total sample size is achieved with the single trial approach. Alternatively, a single trial with the same sample size as the total sample size from two smaller trials will have much greater power. For example, in the case where two trials are each powered at 90\% for two-sided α=0.05 yielding an overall power of 81\%, a single trial using two-sided α=0.001 25 would have 91\% power.

abstract = {Summary.  Problems of the analysis of data with incomplete observations are all too familiar in statistics. They are doubly difficult if we are also uncertain about the choice of model. We propose a general formulation for the discussion of such problems and develop approximations to the resulting bias of maximum likelihood estimates on the assumption that model departures are small. Loss of efficiency in parameter estimation due to incompleteness in the data has a dual interpretation: the increase in variance when an assumed model is correct; the bias in estimation when the model is incorrect. Examples include non-ignorable missing data, hidden confounders in observational studies and publication bias in meta-analysis. Doubling variances before calculating confidence intervals or test statistics is suggested as a crude way of addressing the possibility of undetectably small departures from the model. The problem of assessing the risk of lung cancer from passive smoking is used as a motivating example.},

Drawing on a representative sample of 40 x-phi studies published between 2003 and 2015, we enlisted 20 research teams across 8 countries to conduct a high-quality replication of each study in order to compare the results to the original published findings. We found that x-phi studies -- as represented in our sample -- successfully replicated about 70{\%} of the time. We discuss possible reasons for this relatively high replication rate in the field of experimental philosophy and offer suggestions for best research practices going forward.",

  Abstract                 = {Inference proceeds from ingredients chosen by the analyst and data. To validate any inferences drawn it is essential that the inputs chosen be deemed appropriate for the data. In the Bayesian context these inputs consist of both the sampling model and the prior. There are thus two possibilities for failure: the data may not have arisen from the sampling model, or the prior may place most of its mass on parameter values that are not feasible in light of the data (referred to here as prior-data conflict). Failure of the sampling model can only be fixed by modifying the model, while prior-data conflict can be overcome if sufficient data is available. We examine how to assess whether or not a prior-data conflict exists, and how to assess when its effects can be ignored for inferences. The concept of prior-data conflict is seen to lead to a partial characterization of what is meant by a noninformative prior or a noninformative sequence of priors.},

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.},

abstract = {Replicability is an important feature of scientific research, but aspects of contemporary research culture, such as an emphasis on novelty, can make replicability seem less important than it should be. The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology was set up to provide evidence about the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology by repeating selected experiments from high-impact papers. A total of 50 experiments from 23 papers were repeated, generating data about the replicability of a total of 158 effects. Most of the original effects were positive effects (136), with the rest being null effects (22). A majority of the original effect sizes were reported as numerical values (117), with the rest being reported as representative images (41). We employed seven methods to assess replicability, and some of these methods were not suitable for all the effects in our sample. One method compared effect sizes: for positive effects, the median effect size in the replications was 85\% smaller than the median effect size in the original experiments, and 92\% of replication effect sizes were smaller than the original. The other methods were binary – the replication was either a success or a failure – and five of these methods could be used to assess both positive and null effects when effect sizes were reported as numerical values. For positive effects, 40\% of replications (39/97) succeeded according to three or more of these five methods, and for null effects 80\% of replications (12/15) were successful on this basis; combining positive and null effects, the success rate was 46\% (51/112). A successful replication does not definitively confirm an original finding or its theoretical interpretation. Equally, a failure to replicate does not disconfirm a finding, but it does suggest that additional investigation is needed to establish its reliability.},

In this review article, we discuss the emergence of “adaptive” clinical trials that allow for the preplanned modification of an ongoing clinical trial based on the accumulating evidence with application across translational research. These modifications may include terminating a trial before completion due to futility or efficacy, re-estimating the needed sample size to ensure adequate power, enriching the target population enrolled in the study, selecting across multiple treatment arms, revising allocation ratios used for randomization, or selecting the most appropriate endpoint. Emerging topics related to borrowing information from historic or supplemental data sources, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART), master protocol and seamless designs, and phase I dose-finding studies are also presented. Each design element includes a brief overview with an accompanying case study to illustrate the design method in practice. We close with brief discussions relating to the statistical considerations for these contemporary designs.},

abstract="Iverson, Lee, and Wagenmakers (2009) claimed that Killeen's (2005) statistic prep overestimates the ``true probability of replication.'' We show that Iverson et al. confused the probability of replication of an observed direction of effect with a probability of coincidence---the probability that two future experiments will return the same sign. The theoretical analysis is punctuated with a simulation of the predictions of prep for a realistic random effects world of representative parameters, when those are unknown a priori. We emphasize throughout that prep is intended to evaluate the probability of a replication outcome after observations, not to estimate a parameter. Hence, the usual conventional criteria (unbiasedness, minimum variance estimator) for judging estimators are not appropriate for probabilities such as p and prep.",

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study. The approach is demonstrated by examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating “unsuccessful” replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p > .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) “protecting” true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular. }

 abstract = {We argue that the Bayesian approach is best seen as providing additional tools for those carrying out health-care evaluations, rather than replacing their traditional methods. A distinction is made between those features that arise from the basic Bayesian philosophy and those that come from the modern ability to make inferences using very complex models. Selected examples of the former include explicit recognition of the wide cast of stakeholders in any evaluation, simple use of Bayes theorem and use of a community of prior distributions. In the context of complex models, we selectively focus on the possible role of simple Monte Carlo methods, alternative structural models for incorporating historical data and making inferences on complex functions of indirectly estimated parameters. These selected issues are illustrated by two worked examples presented in a standardized format. The emphasis throughout is on inference rather than decision-making.},

Trials were included irrespective of language or publication status.Review methods~Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence, independently and in duplicate. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ~Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. Random effects model was used for meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach.Results~10 eligible trials enrolled 1426 individuals. Patients who received single low dose corticosteroids (the most common intervention was oral dexamethasone with a maximum dose of 10 mg) were twice as likely to experience pain relief after 24 hours (relative risk 2.2, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3; risk difference 12.4\%; moderate quality evidence) and 1.5 times more likely to have no pain at 48 hours (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8; risk difference 18.3\%; high quality). The mean time to onset of pain relief in patients treated with corticosteroids was 4.8 hours earlier (95\% confidence interval -1.9 to -7.8; moderate quality) and the mean time to complete resolution of pain was 11.1 hours earlier (-0.4 to -21.8; low quality) than in those treated with placebo. The absolute pain reduction at 24 hours (visual analogue scale 0-10) was greater in patients treated with corticosteroids (mean difference 1.3, 95\% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; moderate quality). Nine of the 10 trials sought information regarding adverse events. Six studies reported no adverse effects, and three studies reported few adverse events, which were mostly complications related to disease, with a similar incidence in both groups.Conclusion~Single low dose corticosteroids can provide pain relief in patients with sore throat, with no increase in serious adverse effects. Included trials did not assess the potential risks of larger cumulative doses in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat.Systematic review registration~PROSPERO CRD42017067808.},

    abstract = {The vast majority of published results in the literature is statistically significant, which raises concerns about their reliability. The Reproducibility Project Psychology (RPP) and Experimental Economics Replication Project (EE-RP) both replicated a large number of published studies in psychology and economics. The original study and replication were statistically significant in 36.1% in RPP and 68.8% in EE-RP suggesting many null effects among the replicated studies. However, evidence in favor of the null hypothesis cannot be examined with null hypothesis significance testing. We developed a Bayesian meta-analysis method called snapshot hybrid that is easy to use and understand and quantifies the amount of evidence in favor of a zero, small, medium and large effect. The method computes posterior model probabilities for a zero, small, medium, and large effect and adjusts for publication bias by taking into account that the original study is statistically significant. We first analytically approximate the methods performance, and demonstrate the necessity to control for the original study’s significance to enable the accumulation of evidence for a true zero effect. Then we applied the method to the data of RPP and EE-RP, showing that the underlying effect sizes of the included studies in EE-RP are generally larger than in RPP, but that the sample sizes of especially the included studies in RPP are often too small to draw definite conclusions about the true effect size. We also illustrate how snapshot hybrid can be used to determine the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing and present an easy to use web application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/snapshot/) and R code for applying the method.},

Nonreplication often reflects false positives in the original claims. However, occasionally, nonreplication may be due to heterogeneity due to biases or even genuine diversity of the genetic effects in different populations. Here, we propose methods for estimating the required sample size to replicate an association across many studies with different amounts of between-study heterogeneity, when data are summarized through metaanalysis. We demonstrate thresholds of between-study heterogeneity (τ0 2) above which one cannot reach adequate power to replicate a proposed association at a specified level of statistical significance when k studies are performed (regardless of how large these studies are). Based on empirical evidence from 91 proposed gene{\textendash}disease associations (50 on candidate genes and 41 from genome-wide association efforts), the observed between-study heterogeneity is often close to or even surpasses nonreplicability thresholds. With more modest between-study heterogeneity, the required sample size increases considerably compared with when no between-study heterogeneity exists. Increases are steep as τ0 2 is approached. Therefore, some true associations may not be practically possible to replicate with consistency, no matter how large studies are conducted. Efforts should be made to minimize between-study heterogeneity in targeted genetic effects.},

Analyses were repeated stratifying by use of orphan designation and use of special regulatory programs. Results: There were 273 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in these 3 periods (107 in 1995-1997, 57 in 2005-2007, 109 in 2015-2017), representing 339 indications (157, 64, and 118, respectively). Overall, the proportion of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased (80.6\% in 1995-1997, 60.3\% in 2005-2007, 52.8\% in 2015-2017; p\&lt;0.001). The proportion supported by only single-arm pivotal trials increased (4.0\% in 1995-1997, 12.7\% in 2005-2007, 17.0\% in 2015-2017; p=0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one pivotal trial of 6 months duration (25.8\% in 1995-1997, 34.9\% in 2005-2007, 46.2\% in 2015-2017; p=0.001). When stratified by use of special regulatory programs, pivotal trial characteristics changed over time in divergent ways, both individually and when aggregated by indication approvals. Conclusion: More recent FDA approvals of novel therapeutics were based on fewer pivotal trials, with less rigorous designs but longer trial durations. These findings reinforce the importance of the FDA{\textquoteright}s strategy for requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy after approval.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the Unified Competing Interest form (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: In the past 36 months, Ms. Zhang received research support as a scholar in the Yale-Mayo Clinic FDA CERSI (U01FD005938) and from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation.

	abstract = {We wish to answer this question: If you observe a {\textquoteleft}significant{\textquoteright} p-value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by p-values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3 : 1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p-value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5\%, you would have to assume that you were 87\% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p = 0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100 : 1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8\% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5\% you would need to observe p = 0.00045. It is recommended that the terms {\textquoteleft}significant{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}non-significant{\textquoteright} should never be used. Rather, p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5\%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p-value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p \&lt; 0.05 as {\textquoteleft}statistically significant{\textquoteright}. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomization and p-hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.},

abstract = {Meta-analyses are typically used to estimate the overall/mean of an outcome of interest. However, inference about between-study variability, which is typically modelled using a between-study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between-study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between-study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between-study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between-study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q-profile method and the alternative approach based on a ‘generalised Cochran between-study variance statistic’ to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence-based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios. © 2015 The Authors.

    abstract = { The p-value quantifies the discrepancy between the data and a null hypothesis of interest, usually the assumption of no difference or no effect. A Bayesian approach allows to calibrate p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application Volume 5 is March 7, 2018. Please see https://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates. }

abstract="The statistical test of the hypothesis of no difference between the average bioavailabilities of two drug formulations, usually supplemented by an assessment of what the power of the statistical test would have been if the true averages had been inequivalent, continues to be used in the statistical analysis of bioavailability/bioequivalence studies. In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake (2) based on the usual (shortest) 1--2$\alpha$ confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of $\alpha$=0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are notequivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson (1).",

abstract = {Power priors are used for incorporating historical data in Bayesian analyses by taking the likelihood of the historical data raised to the power α as the prior distribution for the model parameters. The power parameter α is typically unknown and assigned a prior distribution, most commonly a beta distribution. Here, we give a novel theoretical result on the resulting marginal posterior distribution of α in case of the normal and binomial model. Counterintuitively, when the current data perfectly mirror the historical data and the sample sizes from both data sets become arbitrarily large, the marginal posterior of α does not converge to a point mass at α=1 but approaches a distribution that hardly differs from the prior. The result implies that a complete pooling of historical and current data is impossible if a power prior with beta prior for α is used.},
